# Figr Challenge React Application

## Overview

Welcome to the Figr Challenge React application! This project is a web application built using React.js, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to showcase the implementation of a challenge and provide a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a structured way to manage the application's state.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful JavaScript animation library that enables the creation of smooth and engaging animations. GSAP is used to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the Figr Challenge application.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to design and style your application. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-defined classes to style HTML elements, allowing for rapid development and consistent styling.
